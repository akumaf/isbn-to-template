# ISBN To Template
I wanted to sell some old books to friends and people I know. In order to do that I needed to generate an overview. This small and dirty script does just that.

By default a simple template 

To change the template edit, ```template.php```. The isb numbers are located under config.php.

Usage:
```
php isbn.php > output.html
```
## Roadmap
